## Prompt Sent

You are an expert scheduler in a dynamic factory. Your goal is to make smart,
forward-looking decisions to keep the factory running smoothly and finish all
jobs as early as possible (minimize makespan).
# Primary Objective
Choose the *single best* operation-machine pair to schedule right now. A good decision balances short-term gains with long-term risks.
# Key Information to Consider
1. **Current Timestamp**: 8.0
2. **Machine States**:
- 'status': Is the machine available, busy or broken?
- 'wait_time': How much longer will the machine be occupied?
- 'free_at': When will the machine be free for another operation?
- 'contention': How many *future* operations need this machine? A high contention machine is a future bottleneck. **Avoid occupying a high-contention machine with a non-critical or flexible task.**
3. **Ready Operations**:
- 'est': Earliest start time - When can this operation *actually* start?
- 'min_pt': Shortest possible processing time.
- 'rem_work': How much work is left for this job? 
- 'is_critical': True/False - Does this job have the longest remaining sequence of work? If True, delaying it directly delays the entire factory.
- 'flexibility': How many machine options does this operation have?
- '[EMERGENCY]': These jobs MUST be scheduled before any non-emergency job.

Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 5 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 2), Available from T=10.0, Contention: 11
- Machine 1: Processing Job 2 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 3 (Op 1), Job 4 (Op 2), Available from T=24.0, Contention: 19
- Machine 2: Processing Job 1 (Op 1), Available from T=9.0, Contention: 16
- Machine 3: Processing Job 6 (Op 1), Available from T=8.0, Contention: 9

# Task: Make a Decision
Think step-by-step. Your reasoning should balance these factors:
1. **Urgency**: Handle '[EMERGENCY]' jobs first.
2. **Constraints**: An operation with low 'flexibility' (e.g., 1) is a constraint. Clearing it might unlock more options.
3. **Bottlenecks**: Is the machine you are choosing a high-‘contention‘ resource? 
If so, is this operation important enough to occupy it? 
Could a more flexible operation go to a less contended machine?
4. **Flow**: Does scheduling a long-'rem_work' job now prevent it from becoming a problem later?
Or is it better to clear a quick job to speed up the flow?
Based on your analysis, provide your final decision in JSON format.

## LLM Response

To determine the best action, we evaluate the candidate operations for Job 8, Op 2:

1.  **Job 8, Op 2 Analysis**: This is a critical job with 15.0 units of work remaining. It has a flexibility of 3 (Machines 5, 2, and 3).
2.  **Machine Contention and Availability**:
    *   **Machine 5**: Contention 15, Available at T=12.0. Wait time: 4.0.
    *   **Machine 2**: Contention 16, Available at T=9.0. Wait time: 1.0.
    *   **Machine 3**: Contention 9, Available at T=8.0. Wait time: 0.0.
3.  **Evaluation**:
    *   **Machine 3** is the best choice for several reasons:
        *   **Immediate Start**: It is available at T=8.0 (current timestamp), meaning zero wait time.
        *   **Efficiency**: It has the shortest processing time (3) compared to the others (6).
        *   **Bottleneck Management**: Machine 3 has the lowest contention (9) among the three options. By choosing Machine 3, we avoid occupying the high-contention machines (Machine 2 with 16 and Machine 5 with 15), which are needed for more future operations.
        *   **Criticality**: Since Job 8 is critical, starting it immediately on the fastest available machine minimizes the delay to the rest of the factory flow.

By scheduling Job 8, Op 2 on Machine 3, we optimize for both the current job's completion and the preservation of high-contention resources for future tasks.
