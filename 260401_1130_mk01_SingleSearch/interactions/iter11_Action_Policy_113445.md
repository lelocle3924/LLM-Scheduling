## Prompt Sent

You are an expert scheduler in a dynamic factory. Your goal is to make smart,
forward-looking decisions to keep the factory running smoothly and finish all
jobs as early as possible (minimize makespan).
# Primary Objective
Choose the *single best* operation-machine pair to schedule right now. A good decision balances short-term gains with long-term risks.
# Key Information to Consider
1. **Current Timestamp**: 1.0
2. **Machine States**:
- 'status': Is the machine available, busy or broken?
- 'wait_time': How much longer will the machine be occupied?
- 'free_at': When will the machine be free for another operation?
- 'contention': How many *future* operations need this machine? A high contention machine is a future bottleneck. **Avoid occupying a high-contention machine with a non-critical or flexible task.**
3. **Ready Operations**:
- 'est': Earliest start time - When can this operation *actually* start?
- 'min_pt': Shortest possible processing time.
- 'rem_work': How much work is left for this job? 
- 'is_critical': True/False - Does this job have the longest remaining sequence of work? If True, delaying it directly delays the entire factory.
- 'flexibility': How many machine options does this operation have?
- '[EMERGENCY]': These jobs MUST be scheduled before any non-emergency job.

Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 0 (Op 0), Available from T=6.0, Contention: 16
- Machine 1: Processing Job 1 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 2 (Op 0), Available from T=12.0, Contention: 26
- Machine 2: Processing Job 5 (Op 0), Available from T=4.0, Contention: 20
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=1.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Processing Job 4 (Op 0), Available from T=3.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 5: Processing Job 7 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 8 (Op 0), Job 9 (Op 0), Job 6 (Op 0), Available from T=6.0, Contention: 19

None available.
Ready Operations:

# Task: Make a Decision
Think step-by-step. Your reasoning should balance these factors:
1. **Urgency**: Handle '[EMERGENCY]' jobs first.
2. **Constraints**: An operation with low 'flexibility' (e.g., 1) is a constraint. Clearing it might unlock more options.
3. **Bottlenecks**: Is the machine you are choosing a high-‘contention‘ resource? 
If so, is this operation important enough to occupy it? 
Could a more flexible operation go to a less contended machine?
4. **Flow**: Does scheduling a long-'rem_work' job now prevent it from becoming a problem later?
Or is it better to clear a quick job to speed up the flow?
Based on your analysis, provide your final decision in JSON format.

'''json
{{"job": <int>, "op": <int>, "machine": <int>}}

## LLM Response

To determine the best action, we analyze the current state:

1.  **Ready Operations**: There is only one ready operation: **Job 3, Op 1**.
2.  **Constraints**: Job 3, Op 1 has a flexibility of 1 (it must be processed on Machine 1) and is marked as `is_critical=True`. This means it is a bottleneck for the entire factory flow.
3.  **Machine Status**: Machine 1 is currently busy until T=12.0. The candidate action indicates a `wait_time` of 11.0 (12.0 - 1.0 = 11.0), which correctly reflects the machine's availability.
4.  **Bottleneck Analysis**: Machine 1 has the highest contention (26) in the factory. However, because Job 3, Op 1 is critical and has no other machine options, we have no choice but to queue it for Machine 1. Delaying this operation would directly delay the completion of Job 3 and potentially the entire factory makespan.
5.  **Decision**: Since it is the only ready operation and it is critical, scheduling it is the only logical step to ensure the factory continues to progress.

```json
{"job": 3, "op": 1, "machine": 1}
```
