## Prompt Sent

You are an expert scheduler in a dynamic factory. Your goal is to make smart,
forward-looking decisions to keep the factory running smoothly and finish all
jobs as early as possible (minimize makespan).
# Primary Objective
Choose the *single best* operation-machine pair to schedule right now. A good decision balances short-term gains with long-term risks.
# Key Information to Consider
1. **Current Timestamp**: 15.0
2. **Machine States**:
- 'status': Is the machine available, busy or broken?
- 'wait_time': How much longer will the machine be occupied?
- 'free_at': When will the machine be free for another operation?
- 'contention': How many *future* operations need this machine? A high contention machine is a future bottleneck. **Avoid occupying a high-contention machine with a non-critical or flexible task.**
3. **Ready Operations**:
- 'est': Earliest start time - When can this operation *actually* start?
- 'min_pt': Shortest possible processing time.
- 'rem_work': How much work is left for this job? 
- 'is_critical': True/False - Does this job have the longest remaining sequence of work? If True, delaying it directly delays the entire factory.
- 'flexibility': How many machine options does this operation have?
- '[EMERGENCY]': These jobs MUST be scheduled before any non-emergency job.

Machine States:
- Machine 0: BROKEN, Available from T=20.0, Contention: 8
- Machine 1: Processing Job 3 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 4 (Op 2), Job 7 (Op 3), Available from T=30.0, Contention: 12
- Machine 2: Processing Job 5 (Op 2), Available from T=17.0, Contention: 11
- Machine 3: Processing Job 1 (Op 3), Available from T=18.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 4: Processing Job 6 (Op 3), Available from T=16.0, Contention: 3
- Machine 5: Processing Job 2 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 8 (Op 4), Available from T=22.0, Contention: 8

[High-Level Assessment]
Global efficiency is achieved by isolating the primary bottleneck (M1) from high-duration, non-critical tasks, reserving its capacity exclusively for the critical path. By utilizing low-contention machines as dynamic buffers, we prevent the queue accumulation that triggers cascading delays during machine breakdowns.

[Low-Level Logic]
IF (is_critical == True) AND (contention > 10), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (est + rem_work) to prioritize critical path velocity.
ELSE IF (rem_work > 4) AND (contention < 9), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (contention) to proactively offload high-duration tasks from potential bottlenecks.
ELSE IF (flexibility < 3) AND (contention > 10), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (est) to prevent queue overflow on saturated resources.
ELSE IF (is_critical == False) AND (min_pt < 4), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (est) to maximize immediate machine utilization.
Ready Operations:
- Job 9, Op 3: est=22.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False

# Task: Make a Decision
Think step-by-step. Your reasoning should balance these factors:
1. **Urgency**: Handle '[EMERGENCY]' jobs first.
2. **Constraints**: An operation with low 'flexibility' (e.g., 1) is a constraint. Clearing it might unlock more options.
3. **Bottlenecks**: Is the machine you are choosing a high-‘contention‘ resource? 
If so, is this operation important enough to occupy it? 
Could a more flexible operation go to a less contended machine?
4. **Flow**: Does scheduling a long-'rem_work' job now prevent it from becoming a problem later?
Or is it better to clear a quick job to speed up the flow?
Based on your analysis, provide your final decision in JSON format.

## LLM Response

To determine the best scheduling decision, we analyze the current state of the factory:

1.  **Job 9, Op 3 Analysis**:
    *   **Criticality**: This job is marked as `is_critical=True`.
    *   **Flexibility**: It has a flexibility of 1 (only Machine 5 is available for this operation).
    *   **Urgency**: It is a critical path operation that needs to be cleared to allow Job 9 to proceed to its subsequent operations (Op 4 and Op 5).
    *   **Machine 5 Status**: Machine 5 is currently busy until T=22.0. The operation has a processing time of 1.0. 
    *   **Logic Application**: According to the provided logic, since the job is critical and has low flexibility, it must be prioritized to prevent downstream delays. Even though Machine 5 has a contention of 8, the lack of flexibility for Job 9 (Op 3) makes this the only viable path to progress the critical path.

2.  **Job 111 Analysis**:
    *   Job 111 is also ready, but Job 9 is identified as `is_critical=True`. In a constrained environment, prioritizing the critical path is the primary objective to minimize makespan.

3.  **Conclusion**:
    Scheduling Job 9, Op 3 on Machine 5 is the most logical step. It clears a critical path bottleneck with low flexibility, ensuring that the machine is ready to process this task as soon as it becomes available at T=22.0.

{"job": 9, "op": 3, "machine": 5}
