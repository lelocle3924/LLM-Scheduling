## Prompt Sent

You are an expert scheduler in a dynamic factory. Your goal is to make smart,
forward-looking decisions to keep the factory running smoothly and finish all
jobs as early as possible (minimize makespan).
# Primary Objective
Choose the *single best* operation-machine pair to schedule right now. A good decision balances short-term gains with long-term risks.
# Key Information to Consider
1. **Current Timestamp**: 20.0
2. **Machine States**:
- 'status': Is the machine available, busy or broken?
- 'wait_time': How much longer will the machine be occupied?
- 'free_at': When will the machine be free for another operation?
- 'contention': How many *future* operations need this machine? A high contention machine is a future bottleneck. **Avoid occupying a high-contention machine with a non-critical or flexible task.**
3. **Ready Operations**:
- 'est': Earliest start time - When can this operation *actually* start?
- 'min_pt': Shortest possible processing time.
- 'rem_work': How much work is left for this job? 
- 'is_critical': True/False - Does this job have the longest remaining sequence of work? If True, delaying it directly delays the entire factory.
- 'flexibility': How many machine options does this operation have?
- '[EMERGENCY]': These jobs MUST be scheduled before any non-emergency job.

Machine States:
- Machine 0: BROKEN, Available from T=20.0, Contention: 5
- Machine 1: Processing Job 4 (Op 2) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 3), Job 5 (Op 3), Available from T=36.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 2: Processing Job 3 (Op 3), Available from T=24.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=20.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 4: Processing Job 111 (Op 1), Available from T=22.0, Contention: 1
- Machine 5: Processing Job 8 (Op 4) | Queue: Job 9 (Op 3), Job 2 (Op 2), Job 1 (Op 4), Available from T=33.0, Contention: 5
[111]
[High-Level Assessment]
Global efficiency is achieved by isolating the primary bottleneck (M1) from high-duration, non-critical tasks, reserving its capacity exclusively for the critical path. By utilizing low-contention machines as dynamic buffers, we prevent the queue accumulation that triggers cascading delays during machine breakdowns.

[Low-Level Logic]
IF (is_critical == True) AND (contention > 10), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (est + rem_work) to prioritize critical path velocity.
ELSE IF (rem_work > 4) AND (contention < 9), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (contention) to proactively offload high-duration tasks from potential bottlenecks.
ELSE IF (flexibility < 3) AND (contention > 10), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (est) to prevent queue overflow on saturated resources.
ELSE IF (is_critical == False) AND (min_pt < 4), THEN assign to the machine with the lowest (est) to maximize immediate machine utilization.
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 4: est=24.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=4.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False

# Task: Make a Decision
Think step-by-step. Your reasoning should balance these factors:
1. **Urgency**: Handle '[EMERGENCY]' jobs first.
2. **Constraints**: An operation with low 'flexibility' (e.g., 1) is a constraint. Clearing it might unlock more options.
3. **Bottlenecks**: Is the machine you are choosing a high-‘contention‘ resource? 
If so, is this operation important enough to occupy it? 
Could a more flexible operation go to a less contended machine?
4. **Flow**: Does scheduling a long-'rem_work' job now prevent it from becoming a problem later?
Or is it better to clear a quick job to speed up the flow?
Based on your analysis, provide your final decision in JSON format.

{{"job": <int>, "op": <int>, "machine": <int>}}

## LLM Response

To determine the best scheduling decision, we evaluate the provided candidate action against the current factory state:

1.  **Urgency and Constraints**: Job 0, Op 4 is marked as `is_critical=True`. It has a flexibility of 1, meaning it *must* be processed on Machine 2.
2.  **Machine State**: Machine 2 is currently processing Job 3 (Op 3) and will be free at T=24.0. The current timestamp is 20.0.
3.  **Logic Application**:
    *   The operation is critical, and its only available machine is Machine 2.
    *   The `est` (Earliest Start Time) for this operation is 24.0, which aligns perfectly with the time Machine 2 becomes available.
    *   The `rem_work` for Job 0 is 4.0. Scheduling this now ensures that the critical path for Job 0 is not delayed further, as it is the final step before the job enters its next phase.
    *   Machine 2 has a contention of 6, which is moderate. Since the operation has no other machine options (flexibility=1), we have no choice but to commit to this machine.

By scheduling this now, we ensure that as soon as Machine 2 finishes its current task at T=24.0, it immediately transitions to this critical operation, minimizing idle time and maintaining the flow of the critical path.

{"job": 0, "op": 4, "machine": 2}
