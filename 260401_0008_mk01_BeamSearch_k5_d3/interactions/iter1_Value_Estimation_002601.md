# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 26.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 18
- Machine 1: Processing Job 2 (Op 0), Available from T=6.0, Contention: 28
- Machine 2: Processing Job 4 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 0), Available from T=9.0, Contention: 23
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 5: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 24
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=12.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 1, Op 0: est=6.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 3, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=11.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 5, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 6, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 8, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 9, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current factory state shows significant imbalance. While Machines 0, 3, 4, and 5 are idle at T=0.0, there is a high concentration of contention on Machine 1 (28) and Machine 2 (23), both of which are currently occupied. With 7 ready operations and 4 idle machines, the immediate potential for parallel processing is high, but the high contention values on the busy machines suggest a looming bottleneck that will likely push the makespan well beyond the theoretical lower bound of 26.00. The presence of critical jobs (Job 5 and Job 8) that are currently ready but not yet assigned to the available idle machines indicates a failure to prioritize critical path work, risking downstream delays.
