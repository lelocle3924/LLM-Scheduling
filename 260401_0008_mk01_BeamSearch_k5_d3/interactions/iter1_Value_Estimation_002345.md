# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 22.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 18
- Machine 1: Processing Job 4 (Op 0), Available from T=1.0, Contention: 29
- Machine 2: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 23
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 5: Processing Job 7 (Op 0), Available from T=2.0, Contention: 24
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=12.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 1, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 2, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=14.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 3, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=11.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 5, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 6, Op 0: est=2.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 8, Op 0: est=2.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 9, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant imbalance. While machines 0, 2, 3, and 4 are idle at T=0.0, there is a high concentration of contention on machines 1 and 5, which are currently occupied. The presence of critical jobs (Job 5 and Job 8) requires immediate processing, but the high contention values (29 and 24) on the machines currently in use suggest a looming bottleneck that will likely push the makespan significantly beyond the theoretical lower bound of 22.0. The lack of strategic guidance forces a reliance on local heuristics, which are currently failing to distribute the load across the idle machines.
