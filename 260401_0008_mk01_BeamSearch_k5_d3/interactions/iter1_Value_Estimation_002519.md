# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 22.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 17
- Machine 1: Processing Job 2 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 3 (Op 0), Available from T=12.0, Contention: 28
- Machine 2: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 24
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 5: Processing Job 7 (Op 0), Available from T=2.0, Contention: 23
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=12.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 1, Op 0: est=12.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 4, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=22.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 5, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 6, Op 0: est=2.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 8, Op 0: est=2.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 9, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant underutilization of available resources (Machines 0, 2, 3, and 4 are idle at T=0.0) despite having multiple ready operations (Jobs 0, 4, 5, 9). The high contention values on these idle machines suggest they are bottlenecks for upcoming operations, yet they are not being utilized to process the available queue. The critical job (Job 4) is ready but not currently being processed, which poses a risk to the theoretical makespan of 22.0. The imbalance between high-contention idle machines and the pending workload results in poor flow efficiency.
