# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 51.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 29.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 1 (Op 2) | Queue: Job 2 (Op 2), Job 0 (Op 3), Available from T=33.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 1: Processing Job 7 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 4 (Op 2), Job 5 (Op 3), Available from T=43.0, Contention: 11
- Machine 2: Processing Job 3 (Op 3), Available from T=33.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=29.0, Contention: 8
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=29.0, Contention: 1
- Machine 5: Processing Job 8 (Op 4) | Queue: Job 9 (Op 3), Available from T=36.0, Contention: 7
Ready Operations:
- Job 6, Op 4: est=33.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=1.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state exhibits significant imbalance. While Machines 3 and 4 are idle at T=29.0, high-contention machines (0, 1, 2, and 5) are locked into processing or queueing sequences that extend well beyond the current timestamp. Machine 1 is particularly problematic, with a high contention score of 11 and an availability time of 43.0, which severely restricts the throughput of Jobs 4 and 5. The presence of a critical ready operation (Job 6, Op 4) at T=33.0, combined with the current machine availability, suggests a high probability of idle time or missed deadlines, pushing the projected makespan significantly above the 51.00 lower bound.
