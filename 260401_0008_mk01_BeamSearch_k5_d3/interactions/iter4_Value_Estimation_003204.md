# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 26.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 16
- Machine 1: Processing Job 3 (Op 0), Available from T=6.0, Contention: 28
- Machine 2: Processing Job 4 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 0), Job 0 (Op 0), Available from T=13.0, Contention: 22
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 5: Processing Job 8 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 6 (Op 0), Available from T=2.0, Contention: 21
Ready Operations:
- Job 1, Op 0: est=6.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 2, Op 0: est=6.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=14.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 5, Op 0: est=2.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 9, Op 0: est=2.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant imbalance. Machine 1 and Machine 2 are heavily loaded with long-term processing and queues, while Machines 0, 3, and 4 are currently idle. Despite having ready operations (Jobs 1, 2, 5, 9), the system is failing to utilize the available idle capacity to process these tasks, leading to unnecessary queue buildup at Machine 2 and potential starvation for downstream processes. The high contention on Machine 1 (28) and Machine 2 (22) relative to the idle machines indicates poor load balancing, which will likely push the makespan well beyond the theoretical lower bound of 26.00.
