# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 51.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 29.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 6 (Op 3), Job 1 (Op 2), Available from T=31.0, Contention: 8
- Machine 1: Processing Job 7 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 4 (Op 2), Job 5 (Op 3), Job 3 (Op 3), Available from T=44.0, Contention: 12
- Machine 2: Available, Available from T=29.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=29.0, Contention: 8
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=29.0, Contention: 1
- Machine 5: Processing Job 8 (Op 4) | Queue: Job 9 (Op 3), Job 2 (Op 2), Available from T=41.0, Contention: 8
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 3: est=31.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=5.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state exhibits significant imbalance. Machine 1 is heavily bottlenecked (Available T=44.0) with a queue of three operations, while Machines 2, 3, and 4 are completely idle at T=29.0. The critical Job 0, Op 3 is delayed until T=31.0 due to machine unavailability, and the total remaining work relative to the Lower Bound (51.0) suggests that the current idle time on high-capacity machines will inevitably push the makespan well beyond the theoretical minimum.
