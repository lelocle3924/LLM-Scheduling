# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 55.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 41.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 4 (Op 3), Available from T=42.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 1: Processing Job 5 (Op 3) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 3), Available from T=49.0, Contention: 5
- Machine 2: Available, Available from T=41.0, Contention: 2
- Machine 3: Processing Job 8 (Op 5) | Queue: Job 9 (Op 4), Available from T=49.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=41.0, Contention: 1
- Machine 5: Processing Job 0 (Op 5) | Queue: Job 1 (Op 4), Available from T=52.0, Contention: 3
Ready Operations:
- Job 2, Op 3: est=41.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=5.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant imbalance. While Machines 2 and 4 are idle at T=41.0, high-contention machines (1, 3, and 5) are locked into long-duration tasks until T=49.0–52.0. The presence of a critical operation (Job 2, Op 3) with a remaining processing time of 5.0 units, coupled with the fact that the theoretical makespan is 55.0, leaves very little slack for the remaining operations. The high contention on machines currently processing tasks suggests a bottleneck that will likely push the makespan beyond the 55.0 lower bound.
