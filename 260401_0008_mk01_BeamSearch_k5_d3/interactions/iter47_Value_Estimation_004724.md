# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 56.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 41.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=41.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 1: Processing Job 5 (Op 3) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 3), Job 2 (Op 3), Available from T=55.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 2: Available, Available from T=41.0, Contention: 1
- Machine 3: Processing Job 8 (Op 5) | Queue: Job 9 (Op 4), Available from T=49.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=41.0, Contention: 1
- Machine 5: Processing Job 0 (Op 5) | Queue: Job 1 (Op 4), Available from T=52.0, Contention: 2
Ready Operations:
- Job 4, Op 4: est=49.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=10.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant imbalance. Machine 1 is heavily backlogged (14 units of processing time remaining), while Machines 0, 2, and 4 are idle at T=41.0. With a theoretical lower bound of 56.0, the current bottleneck on Machine 1 (finishing at T=55.0) leaves almost no buffer for subsequent operations, creating a high risk of exceeding the optimal makespan. The presence of a critical operation (Job 4, Op 4) that cannot start until T=49.0 further constrains the flow.
