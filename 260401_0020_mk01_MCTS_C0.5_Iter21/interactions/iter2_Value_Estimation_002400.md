# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 22.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 17
- Machine 1: Processing Job 4 (Op 0), Available from T=1.0, Contention: 29
- Machine 2: Processing Job 7 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 0 (Op 0), Available from T=8.0, Contention: 22
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 5: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 24
Ready Operations:
- Job 1, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 2, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=14.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 3, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=11.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 5, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 6, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 8, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 9, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant imbalance. While machines 0, 3, 4, and 5 are idle, high-contention machines (specifically Machine 1 and Machine 2) are currently occupied or queued, creating a bottleneck for critical jobs (Job 5 and Job 8). The presence of 7 ready operations against 4 idle machines suggests an immediate scheduling opportunity, but the high contention values on the occupied machines indicate that the current path is likely to exceed the 22.00 theoretical makespan due to poor resource distribution.
