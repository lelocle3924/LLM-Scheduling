# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 27.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 6.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 4 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 5 (Op 1), Available from T=9.0, Contention: 12
- Machine 1: Processing Job 1 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 2 (Op 0), Job 3 (Op 1), Available from T=19.0, Contention: 22
- Machine 2: Processing Job 9 (Op 0), Available from T=8.0, Contention: 18
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=6.0, Contention: 9
- Machine 4: Processing Job 8 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 0 (Op 1), Available from T=11.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 5: Processing Job 7 (Op 1), Available from T=10.0, Contention: 17
Ready Operations:
- Job 6, Op 2: est=8.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=6.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current factory state exhibits significant imbalance. Machine 1 is a severe bottleneck with a projected availability of T=19.0, which is nearly 70% of the total theoretical makespan (27.0). Machine 3 is currently idle, yet high-contention tasks are queued behind overloaded machines (Machine 1 and Machine 0). The critical operation (Job 6, Op 2) is delayed until T=8.0 due to lack of machine availability, threatening the lower bound.
