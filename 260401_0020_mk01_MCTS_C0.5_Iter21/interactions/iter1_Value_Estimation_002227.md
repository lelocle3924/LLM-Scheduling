# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 22.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 18
- Machine 1: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 30
- Machine 2: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 25
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 7
- Machine 5: Processing Job 8 (Op 0), Available from T=1.0, Contention: 24
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=12.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 1, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 2, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=14.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 3, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=11.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 4, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=22.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 5, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=17.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 6, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 7, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=19.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 9, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current factory state exhibits significant imbalance. While there are 5 available machines, the contention levels are heavily skewed toward Machines 0, 1, and 2 (18, 30, and 25 respectively), while Machines 3 and 4 remain underutilized (10 and 7). There are 8 ready operations competing for these resources, and the presence of a high-workload critical job (Job 4, rem_work=22.0) combined with high-contention assignments suggests a high probability of future queuing delays that will push the makespan well beyond the theoretical minimum of 22.0.
