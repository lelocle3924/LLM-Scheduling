# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 22.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 0.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 18
- Machine 1: Processing Job 4 (Op 0), Available from T=1.0, Contention: 29
- Machine 2: Processing Job 5 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 9 (Op 0), Available from T=8.0, Contention: 21
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 10
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=0.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 5: Processing Job 7 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 8 (Op 0), Available from T=3.0, Contention: 21
Ready Operations:
- Job 0, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=12.0, flexibility=2, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 1, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=16.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 2, Op 0: est=1.0, min_pt=6, rem_work=14.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 3, Op 0: est=0.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=11.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False
- Job 6, Op 0: est=3.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=9.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=False, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state shows significant imbalance. While Machines 0, 3, and 4 are idle, the high-contention machines (1, 2, and 5) are occupied with long-duration tasks, creating a bottleneck for the remaining ready operations. Specifically, Job 1 (Critical) is delayed by the unavailability of resources until T=1.0, and the queue on Machine 2 suggests a growing backlog that threatens the theoretical makespan of 22.0. The disparity between idle capacity and high-contention resource saturation indicates poor load balancing.
