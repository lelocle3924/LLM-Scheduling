# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 39.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 11.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 7 (Op 2), Available from T=11.0, Contention: 11
- Machine 1: Processing Job 2 (Op 0) | Queue: Job 3 (Op 1), Job 4 (Op 2), Available from T=25.0, Contention: 17
- Machine 2: Processing Job 6 (Op 2) | Queue: Job 1 (Op 1), Job 5 (Op 2), Available from T=17.0, Contention: 12
- Machine 3: Available, Available from T=11.0, Contention: 8
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=11.0, Contention: 4
- Machine 5: Processing Job 9 (Op 1) | Queue: Job 0 (Op 2), Available from T=18.0, Contention: 11
Ready Operations:
- Job 8, Op 3: est=11.0, min_pt=2, rem_work=12.0, flexibility=1, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The current state exhibits significant imbalance. While Machines 3 and 4 are idle at T=11.0, Machines 1 and 2 are heavily backlogged with queues that extend well beyond the current timestamp (Machine 1 available at T=25.0). The high contention on Machine 1 (17) relative to its availability indicates a severe bottleneck that threatens the theoretical makespan of 39.0. The presence of a critical operation (Job 8, Op 3) that is ready but potentially delayed by the current machine allocation further degrades the flow efficiency.
