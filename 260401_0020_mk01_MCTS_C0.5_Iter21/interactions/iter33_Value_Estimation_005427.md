# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 40.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 21.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 2 (Op 2), Available from T=21.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 1: Processing Job 4 (Op 2) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 3), Job 5 (Op 3), Available from T=37.0, Contention: 8
- Machine 2: Processing Job 6 (Op 4) | Queue: Job 3 (Op 2), Job 0 (Op 4), Available from T=24.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 3: Processing Job 8 (Op 5), Available from T=27.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=21.0, Contention: 2
- Machine 5: Processing Job 9 (Op 3), Available from T=21.0, Contention: 6
Ready Operations:
- Job 1, Op 4: est=21.0, min_pt=1, rem_work=1.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The factory state shows significant imbalance. Machine 1 is heavily backlogged (available at T=37.0, which is nearly the total theoretical makespan of 40.0), creating a severe bottleneck that will inevitably push the final completion time well beyond the 40.0 lower bound. Machine 4 is idle despite the presence of ready operations (Job 1, Op 4), indicating poor dispatching logic. High contention on machines 1, 2, 3, and 5, combined with the late availability of Machine 1, suggests a high probability of idle time for downstream operations and a failure to meet the efficiency target.
