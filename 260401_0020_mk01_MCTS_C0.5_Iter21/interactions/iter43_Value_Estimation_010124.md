# Factory State Evaluation Rules
You are an expert factory flow evaluator. Your objective is to score the "health" of a partial schedule state from 0.0 (deadlocked, bottlenecked) to 1.000 (perfect flow, zero wait times).

## Mathematical Grounding (CRITICAL)
The absolute minimum theoretical makespan from this state is 45.00.
You must mathematically ground your evaluation using this Lower Bound:
- If a state has a Lower Bound that is drastically higher than expected or higher than previous baselines, it is a bad timeline. Score it closer to 0.000.
- You must NOT hallucinate a timeline faster than the Lower Bound.

# Current Factory State
Timestamp: 21.0
Machine States:
- Machine 0: Processing Job 1 (Op 4), Available from T=22.0, Contention: 5
- Machine 1: Processing Job 4 (Op 2) | Queue: Job 7 (Op 3), Job 5 (Op 3), Job 9 (Op 4), Available from T=43.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 2: Processing Job 6 (Op 4) | Queue: Job 3 (Op 2), Job 0 (Op 4), Available from T=24.0, Contention: 6
- Machine 3: Processing Job 8 (Op 5), Available from T=27.0, Contention: 5
- Machine 4: Available, Available from T=21.0, Contention: 2
- Machine 5: Available, Available from T=21.0, Contention: 5
Ready Operations:
- Job 2, Op 3: est=21.0, min_pt=4, rem_work=5.0, flexibility=3, is_critical=True, [EMERGENCY]=False


# Strategic Guidance
None available.

# Evaluation Task
Evaluate the schedule health by checking:
1. Machine Utilization: Are high-contention machines overloaded while others sit idle? (Lower score)
2. Starvation: Are there many ready operations but no available machines? (Lower score)
3. Flow: Is work flowing smoothly with minimal wait times between operations? (Higher score)
4. Strategic Alignment: Does the state align well with the provided Strategic Guidance?

Do not provide lengthy reasoning. You MUST output your final evaluation as a single float enclosed in XML tags exactly like this:
<score>
0.725
</score>

## LLM Response

The factory state exhibits significant imbalance. Machine 1 is severely bottlenecked with a queue extending to T=43.0, nearly equal to the theoretical minimum makespan (45.0), while Machines 4 and 5 are idle. The presence of a critical operation (Job 2, Op 3) with no immediate machine assignment despite available capacity on Machines 4 and 5 indicates poor scheduling efficiency. The high contention on Machines 1, 2, and 3, coupled with the inability to clear the queue before the theoretical makespan limit, severely degrades the flow.
